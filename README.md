Welcome to Diego and Ian's PA3 project

We do not own any of the music in this project

Directions:

To switch between modes press:
'1' for mode 1
'2' for mode 2
'3' for mode 3
'4' for custom mode
'=' to increase recursion level
'-' to decrease recursion level
' ' to activate animation

All modes can be activated at the same time or individually, animations can also be activated in the same way.
When none of the modes are activated zeroMode is displayed by default, which is a simple text.

Thank you
